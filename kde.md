# KDE

Hi,

KDE is a community of technologists, designers, writers and advocates which
ensures the availability of free software usable by anyone. Its most famous
products are the _Plasma Workspaces_. In this short guide, the focus will
be on those workspaces, still  there are some hints to let you discover more
at the end of this guide.

The following is all about showing you how neat and efficient Plasma Desktop
is. We will have an overview of applications and concepts which make you feel
comfortable and productive. Allowing you to adapt the software to your needs
is the KDE way of life, we hope you will enjoy it. If you are in the mood to
contribute, know that you can collaborate in many ways such as translation,
promotion, artwork and much more.

Kind regards,
KDE.
