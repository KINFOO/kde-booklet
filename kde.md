# KDE

Hi,

KDE is a community of technologists, designers, writers and advocates which
ensures the availability of free software usable by anyone. Its most famous
products are the _Plasma Workspaces_. In this short guide, the focus will
be on those workspaces, still  there are some hints to let you discover more
at the end of this guide.

The following is all about showing you how neat and efficient Plasma Desktop
is. We will have an overview of applications and concepts which make you feel
comfortable and productive. Allowing you to adapt the software to your needs
is the KDE way of life, we hope you will enjoy it. If you are in the mood to
contribute, know that you can collaborate in many ways such as translation,
promotion, artwork and much more.

Kind regards,
KDE.

## Plasma Workspaces

_Plasma Workspaces_ gather several user focused environments. Each of those
environments provides the tools necessary to interact with your devices.
Plasma Workspaces contains several environment variants. The most famous is
_Plasma Desktop_, which is tailored for _desktop and laptop_ computers. There
are also _Plasma Netbook_ better suited for _small screens_, and _Plasma
Active_ adapted to consumer electronics.

## Activities

You use your laptop at work and at home? Activities are made for you.
You may plan your next vacations, write a report, work on your photos, etc.
You probably need a different set of applications per activity. Simply save
the current context, and reload it when you want. Also while you are busy
with an activity, you are not interrupted by the other activities, it is
much easier to focus.

## Calligra

Every worthy desktop environment has its own office software suite, _Calligra_
is a _productivity and artistic suite_. It got it all _Calligra Words_ for word
processing, _Calligra Stage_ for presentations, _Calligra Sheets_ for
spreadsheets, _Krita_ for sketching and painting, _Karbon_ for vector graphics
and even more. This suite is mature and can help you to perform your daily
tasks.

an application for each aspect of your personal information. _KMail_ provides
you the most advanced email features. _KOrganizer_ allows you to handle your
